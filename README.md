# Classification-with-ANN-Churn-Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) capable of forecasting customer behavior within a bank. Specifically, the ANN will analyze a combination of geographic, demographic, and transactional data to predict whether a customer is likely to remain with the bank or leave (customer churn). Additionally, the model will assign a probability score to each customer, effectively ranking them based on their likelihood of churning. This ranking will provide valuable insights into which customers are at higher risk of leaving, enabling the bank to implement targeted retention strategies and improve overall customer retention.
